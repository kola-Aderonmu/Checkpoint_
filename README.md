//Declaration of the variable.

 Initialize three counters: CharacterCounter = 0, wordCounter = 0, vowelCounter = 0. i = 0, Space_Counter = 0 [All as INTEGER]

Also initialize [sentence: STRING]

[Read/Display/Print] out the 'sentence'.

 Loop through the 'sentence' to find the LENGTH:

	a.If space is identified then increment "space_counter" by 1.
	b. Or increment Character_counter by 1.

 If the character is a vowel (you can define a set of vowels like 'aeiouAEIOU'):
        i. Increment vowelCounter.
   
 Increment space_counter by 1 and assign to word_counter.

Print out the values of the variable.
